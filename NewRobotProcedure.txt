1. create or find urdf along with meshes. Googling for robot urdf.
 Sometimes it is a .xacro extension in which case, need to use ROS to convert xacro to plain urdf.

2. Create new folder with robot name

3. Place urdf at root of new folder and place meshes in separate folder at root keeping same package names in case of ROS robots

4. Make sure that all 3d model files are of type obj

5. Import into unity using UrdfImporter
- visually check BioIK joints and meshes
- If there is the following error:
  IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
  Check that there are no xyz or rpy values that have the format 0. as this cannot be parsed as a float

6. Add LeftHandTarget and RightHandTarget to base imported object
7. To targets add BioSegment script and set Character and Parent to base robot game object. Set Transform to own transform

8. Go through all moveable joints in BioIK script and verify movement

9. Add LeftHandTarget and RightHandTarget as position and orientation objective to appropriate joint in joint list

10. Zero position and orientation of targets with respect to the transform of the joint that they are assigned to

11. Add a camera and audio source to the robot, attached to where the human's viewpoint will be

12. Add NaoAnimusDriver script to the object and wire up the sensors, robot make and model as well as the base point (point of attachment for OVR Rig) and the target objects

13. Test out movement of robot by moving target

14. Add rigidbody component to base game object with 
- mass 150 
- angular drag 0.05
- isKinematic off


15 add head meshes to meshes to disable array to clear visual field when not in training mode
